# NineBillionName
according to the short story <the nine billion name of god> of Clarke I wrote a C Code.
but sadlly I found the Chineses version is not correct. about the 3 letter repeat, the original book is:'the letter must occur more than three times in succession.'
the information I got from my book is the letter must occur more than 3 times in the name. the tarslater missed the word succession.
